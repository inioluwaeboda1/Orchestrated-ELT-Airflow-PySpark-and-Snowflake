# Orchestrated-ELT-Airflow-PySpark-and-Snowflake
A modern ELT pipeline for the Superstore dataset using Airflow, AWS S3, Lambda, PySpark, and Snowflake. Data is ingested daily into S3, validated with Lambda, transformed into partitioned Parquet via PySpark, and loaded into Snowflake. It demonstrates cloud-native orchestration, scalable data engineering, and SQL analytics.
